## Overview 
This project includes designing and developing a Call Centre Dashboard to display key performance metrics, analyze call trends, and get insights into customer interactions. The dashboard is built using Excel, data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations.

## Objectives
- Track call centre performance metrics (e.g., total calls, revenue, ratings).
- Assess the correlation between call volume and revenue generation.
- Understand the gender-based distribution of callers across different locations.
- Track agent ratings and performance trends to identify top and low performers and Improve training and support based on those insights.
- Evaluate revenue contribution of customer representatives across different locations.
  
## Findings and Conclusion

- **Call Volume Trends:** Peak periods vary across the week, aiding workforce optimization.
- **Calls vs Revenue:** Higher call volume does not always lead to higher revenue, emphasizing call quality and efficiency.
- **Gender Distribution:** Some locations have more female callers, enabling targeted customer engagement.
- **Revenue Distribution:** Certain regions generate higher revenue, identifying high-value customer bases for strategic focus.

The Call Centre Dashboard offers key insights into calls, agents, customers, and revenue, enabling better management, targeted engagement, improved service, and optimized revenue for data-driven growth.
